            <h2>Background</h2>
            <P>My name is Stephen Le. I grew up in the suburbs of Rochester, New York. I had a largely normal upbringing, though I was admittedly a troubled youth. I loved rock music, motorsports, and hanging out with my friends. I was very active as a kid. I would spend my days skateboarding, riding BMX, mountani biking, and playing paintball. When I turned 16, everything changed. I got my licence, and the only thing I wanted to do was drive around with my friends and girlfriend. Life was simple until it wasn't.</P>

            <P>After a series of poor life choices, at the age of 19, I was convicted to Manslaughter and sentenced to 22years of incarceration. During that time, I focused on bettering myself. I began with improving my physical fitness through powerlifting. In under a year, with extreme dedication, I was able to squat 560lbs, deadlift 495lbs, and benchpress 225lbs. during this time I also started working on my spiritual health. I found my faith in God, and began going to church, being an active member of the community, and studying the Bible. I also, started educating myself. It started with my need to file post-conviction legal briefs. Teaching myself the law through consistent attendence to the law-library, I eventually earned my legal research certificate, and a position as a law-library clerk. In this new role I was able to give other Incarcerated Individuals post-conviction relief, even though I was unsuccessful with myself. This was the spark that ignited my pation for education.</P>

            <p>After six years, my classification lowered to a <em>Maximum B</em>, and I was able to put in for a preference transfer. After speaking with my family, we decided that transfering to Greenhaven Correctional Facility, even though it was further away from home, was best because I would have an opportunity to attend college, through the Bard Prison Initiative, and earn my degree. I studied and earned my Associate of Arts degree after two years. I had to wait two additional years to apply to the Bachelor's program, and in that time took every class available to me. By 2021, I earned my B.A in Mathematics, with a minor microbiology. I was then transfered to a medium classification facility where i continued my education with BPI, and earned my concentration in Public Health, and took various computer science courses.</p>

            <p>After 19 years of incarceration, I was finally released as a new man. Growing up in pison taught me patience, and to endure. Where others find abandonment, I find solace. I not only learned to shape my own future, but also learned that my life is only where it is at because of all the love and support I recieved while incarcerated. This taught me how to evaluate what matters in life. Beginning the thrid quarter of my life, my goal is to chase my dream of becoming a successful computer programmer. I want to have a successful career, so that I may be able to give back to those who supported me, and start a family of my own.</p>
